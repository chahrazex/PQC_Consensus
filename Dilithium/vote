As mentioned in the document, the use of the Dilithium signature scheme may lead to a reduction in the number of Transactions Per Second (TPS) due to the large signature size. In a network like an energy internet, where a high volume of transactions may be processed, scalability is crucial. To address this, you may need to optimize the consensus algorithm or consider parallel processing techniques to improve scalability."
